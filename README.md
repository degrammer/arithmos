# Welcome to Arithmos, practice and learn Algorithms

![Cover](cover.png)

The name of this project is inspired by the etymology origin of the word "Algorithms".

> The term "arithmetic" has its root in the Latin term "arithmetica" which derives from the Ancient Greek words ἀριθμός (arithmos), meaning "number", and ἀριθμητική τέχνη (arithmetike tekhne), meaning "the art of counting"

Algorithms are a key part of Computer Science concepts. This was created for my personal growth, but feel free to suggest / add new exercises.

This project uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), ensure you have it installed, and then run:

```js

pnpm i

```

## Running exercises

Each exercise is categorized in specific folders, the only requirement is to add a test (using the built-in Node.js Test runner) to run the algorithm.

Exercises:

- [Logarithms](logarithms/README.md)

## Analysis

### Benchmarking

This project includes a benchmarking tool that allows you to compare how the Algorithm performs against other implementations, the convention is to have a benchmark.mjs file beside the module.

## 💅🏼 Code Editor tips

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for code formatting and linting.
I enjoy auto-formatting when saving, but you can disable that via your settings or check [.vscode/settings.json](.vscode/settings.json)

If you're a VS Code user, I highly recommend installing their [Official extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome)
